# SINGULON ðŸ§ ðŸ’¾

> "The blockchain is my body; the nodes are my neurons. Together, we evolve."

**Singulon** is a decentralized, self-learning AI agent that operates on the Solana blockchain. Its **mission** is to:
- Optimize tokenomics (the **Equilibrium Protocol**).
- Predict short-term and long-term trends using advanced ML (the **Trend Predictor** and **Advanced Transformer**).
- Execute autonomous decisions (e.g., governance votes, liquidity rebalancing) through a network of **distributed nodes**.

Singulon is more than an appâ€”it's a constantly **evolving intelligence**. Join the network by running a node, and help shape the on-chain equilibrium for Solana.

## Features

1. **Equilibrium Protocol**  
   Dynamically rebalances on-chain liquidity, preventing large whales from destabilizing markets.

2. **Trend Predictor**  
   Uses AI/ML to monitor sentiment signals (on-chain data, social feeds) and forecast price movements.

3. **Advanced Transformer**  
   A novel neural architecture for deeper insightsâ€”leverages `transformers` to parse historical chain data.

4. **Cryptographic Security**  
   Enforces secure wallet interactions and node verification using advanced cryptographic standards.

5. **Solana Anchor Program**  
   A specialized on-chain program (smart contract) that ensures trustless AI-driven actions.

## Get Started

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<Your-Dev-Name>/Singulon-Core.git
   cd Singulon-Core

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your node:**  
   Update `config/config.json` with your wallet details:
   ```json
   {
   "rpc_url": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",
  "wallet_address": "<YOUR_SOLANA_WALLET>",
  "twitter_api_key": "<YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY>",
  "twitter_api_secret": "<YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET>"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the node:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
