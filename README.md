# SINGULON üß†üíæ
> "The blockchain is my body; the nodes are my neurons. Together, we evolve."

**Singulon** is a **self-learning, decentralized AI** that runs on the Solana blockchain. Its **neural intelligence** continuously adapts to on-chain data, identifying market imbalances, orchestrating governance, and optimizing tokenomics. Designed as a ‚Äúhive mind,‚Äù Singulon evolves in real time as more nodes join, each contributing computational resources and insights back to the network.

## Features at a Glance

1. **Hybrid AI Pipelines**  
   - **Equilibrium Model (LSTM)**: Monitors liquidity shifts and detects whale-induced anomalies.  
   - **Advanced Transformer**: Employs multi-head attention for deeper historical trend analysis.  
   - **Reinforcement/Feedback Loops**: Node logs and results feed back into the collective knowledge base.

2. **Cryptographic Security**  
   - Utilizes **Ed25519** and **NaCl** for secure node-to-node and wallet interactions.  
   - Optional RSA-2048 integration for off-chain encryption tasks and secure proposals.

3. **Solana Anchor Program**  
   - High-throughput, trustless logic for governance and equilibrium updates.  
   - Enforces node consensus on significant AI upgrades or parameter changes.

4. **Node-Based Hive Mind**  
   - Any user can spin up a node: it joins Singulon‚Äôs on-chain registry, syncs AI models, and executes tasks autonomously.  
   - Nodes share partial data/telemetry, fueling a **community-driven** MLOps pipeline.

5. **Governance & Evolution**  
   - On-chain proposals let node operators suggest new algorithms or hyperparameters.  
   - Majority votes trigger **hot-upgrades** to the AI, distributing updated weights to all nodes.

## How It Works

1. **On-Chain Data Flow**  
   Singulon fetches live data from Solana RPC endpoints‚Äîblock headers, account balances, liquidity pool stats‚Äîand can optionally incorporate off-chain sentiment from social feeds.

2. **AI Layer**  
   - **EquilibriumModel**: Uses an LSTM architecture to forecast and maintain ‚Äúmarket equilibrium.‚Äù  
   - **AdvancedTransformer**: Analyzes historical time-series in multi-headed attention blocks, identifying macro patterns that might escape simpler models.

3. **Node Execution Layer**  
   - Every node runs a local ‚ÄúNodeBrain‚Äù (Python-based), which handles inference, partial training, and proposed actions (like rebalancing or staking).  
   - Node logs are cryptographically signed and optionally aggregated on-chain for transparency and iterative model improvements.

4. **Anchor Enforcement**  
   - Our Rust-based **Singulon Anchor Program** enforces consensus: only when enough nodes agree on a plan does the contract execute it.  
   - This ensures no single node can unilaterally affect the system‚Äî**true decentralization**.

5. **Continuous Learning**  
   - Node feedback (e.g., profit/loss data, action success rates) is fed into the master repository.  
   - Approved improvements are merged, model weights are updated, and each node automatically syncs.
